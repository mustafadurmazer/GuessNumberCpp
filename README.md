GuessNameCpp

Hello everyone,

I created a number guessing game in C++. The game adapts based on the input provided by the user. We give the user control over the difficulty level, and using a kind of try-catch logic, we ensure that only inputs meeting the required conditions are accepted. The game works smoothly and runs without issues.
